* This is a portfolio Website, that has three pages and uses botstrap and is responsive to all screen sizes.

* Three pages are:
    * Main page (index.html)
    * Gallery of projects (portfolio.html)
    * Contact form (contact.html)

* Shrinking the tabs will show the different layouts depending on the screen size.

* All links works except the contact form. New functionalities will be added soon with Javascript and the design will be improved gradually.

* Here is a screen shot of the main page as seen on a basic laptop screen size: https://github.com/ahtiap/code-portfolio/blob/master/portfolio-screenshot.png?raw=true
